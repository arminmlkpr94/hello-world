# hello-world
learning github :)

it has already been too lte for me to learn git, but better late than never

issues are for discussing bugs and other issues 
changes are called commits 
when you want to apply your changes to the source file ( master branch ) you make a pull request and if gets accepted, the changes are merged into the master branch
